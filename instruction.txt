# Instructions to Publish to NPM

1. **Login to NPM**
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter your username, password, and email.

2. **Update Package Information**
   Ensure `package.json` has the correct `name`, `version`, `description`, and `author`.
   The `main` field should point to `dist/server.js` (or your entry point).
   Check `dependencies` and ensure all sensitive info is in `.env` (which is gitignored).

3. **Build the Project**
   Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Publish**
   Run the publish command:
   ```bash
   npm publish --access public
   ```
   (Remove `--access public` if you want a private package and have a paid account).

5. **Updating Versions**
   When releasing updates, increment the version in `package.json` manually or run:
   ```bash
   npm version patch  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
   npm version minor  # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
   npm version major  # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0
   ```
   Then run `npm publish` again.
